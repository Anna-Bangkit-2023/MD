## 📱 Mobile Developent
Creating an Android application begins with designing its layout in Figma, followed by implementation using XML. The app connects to a machine learning model via an API using Retrofit. Key features include chatting with an AI-integrated chatbot, where messages can be sent as text or voice. Voice messages are recorded using MediaRecorder and played back with MediaPlayer. The app also supports loading chat history using PagingData. Additional features include a dictionary and the ability to manage account sessions and themes through preferences.
